}}

\item{nRep}{Number of replicate runs with the same parameter set}

\item{nGen}{Number of generations simulated. This means the model is simulates nGen*nTrees birth-death events}

\item{nSteps.out}{Number of time steps with model output. If nSteps.out == 1 there is only model output from the last simulated time step. If nSteps.out > 1 there is output over time. The output time itnerval is calculated as nGen/nSteps.out. The initial condition is included in the output. Temporal output works only on combination with avg = F.}

\item{nTrees}{Number of trees in the local community}

\item{Xext}{Size of the local community in x-direction}

\item{Yext}{Size of the local community in y-direction}

\item{dist.max}{Maximum distance (in meters) over which the spatial patterns F(r) and PCF(r) are calculated.}

\item{bin.width}{The distance bin-width used for the calculation of the spatial patterns F(r) and PCF(r),}

\item{meta.SAD}{The abundance distribution of the metacommunity: (0) uniform distribution, (1) log-normal distribution with coefficient of variation metaCV.}

\item{avg}{logical variable: Should the non-temporal model output be averaged over the replicate runs? This works only if nSteps.out == 1.}
}
\value{
The model simulates virtual tree censuses with coordinates and species identities for each tree. The census data of the last simulated time step is only provided as output when nRep = 1 and avg = F. In this case the output is a list with four elements:
\enumerate{
   \item \bold{census} - a dataframe with x,y coordinates and species ID for every tree in the simulated community
   \item \bold{abundance} - a vector with the number of individuals for every species
   \item \bold{species} - a dataframe with species properties: (1) the species ID, (2) the relative abundance in the metacommunity, (3) the mean dispersal distance, (4) the species-specifc conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD)
   \item \bold{summary.stats} - a list with eight elements that includes non-spatial and spatial summary statistics of the simulated community. When nSteps.out == 1 the summary statistics are provided as scalars and vectors and when nStpes.out > 1 as vectors and matrices. The list elements are:
\enumerate{
   \item \bold{nSpecies} - Number of species
   \item \bold{Shannon} - Shannon diversity index \eqn{H = - \sum log(pi) * pi}
   \item \bold{Simpson} - Simpson diversity index \eqn{S = 1 - \sum 1/pi^2}, where pi is the relative abundance of species i. This essentially estimates the probability of randomly drawing two individuals from different species (probability of interspecific encounter)
   \item \bold{SAD} - species abundance distribution with logarithmic abundance classes (1, 2-3, 4-7, 8-15, ..., >=2048 individuals)
   \item \bold{Area} - sampling areas for species area relationship in m^2
   \item \bold{SAR} - species-area relationship: average species numbers in quadrats of different sizes
   \item \bold{Fr} - Proportion of conspecific neighbors: This estimates the probability that two trees seperated by distance r belong to the same species.
   \item \bold{PCF} - pair-correlation function. Measure of spatial aggregation of regularity across scales. A value of 1 indicates a random pattern, PCF > 1 indicates aggregation and PCF < 1 regularity (=repulsion of individuals)
}
}
When nRep > 1 or avg = T only the list with the summary statistics is returned.

\description{
Run the CONFETTI model
}
\details{
There are some constraints on parameter values that override the parameter settings. Species traits, i.e. recruitment probability, dispersal distance, and CNDD are simulated from probability distributions. To avoid biologically unrealistiv values a few constraints are implemented: Recruitment probability is restricted to the interval [0.001; 1]; For dispersal distance there is a lower bound of 0.1 m, and for CNDD the lower bound is 1, which means intraspecific competition equals interspedific competition. This lower bound excludes conspecific positive density dependence.

There can be only one trade-off that involves CNDD. If the parameter settings imply a trade-off between CNDD and recruitment as well as between CNDD and metacommunity abundance, the second one is ignored and just the trade-off with recruitment probability is simulated.
