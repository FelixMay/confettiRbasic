\title{Run the CONFETTI model}
\usage{
confetti.run(pars = c(metaSR = 300, metaCV = 1, m = 0.1, rmax = 10, aRec =
  0.005, disp = 30, CNDD.m = 1, CNDD.cv = 0), nRep = 1, nGen = 100,
  nTrees = 10000, Xext = 500, Yext = 500, avg = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pars}{A vector of eight numbers that include the model parameters for CONFETTI. The vector can be named but need not. Note that the order of parameters matters.

\enumerate{
   \item \bold{metaSR} - Species richness of the metacommunity
   \item \bold{metaCV} - Coefficient of variation (sd/mean) of the metacommunity lognormal abundance distribution
\item \bold{m} - Immigration rate (Interval [0,1])
\item \bold{rmax} - Radius of interactions neighborhood (Interval [0,20])
\item \bold{aRec} - Parameter for recruitment competition (Interval [0,0.1])
\item \bold{disp} - Mean dispersal distance
\item \bold{CNDD.m} - Mean conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD)
\item \bold{CNDD.cv} - Coefficient of variation (sd/mean) of CNDD among species
}}

\item{nRep}{Number of replicate runs with the same parameter set}

\item{nGen}{Number of generations simulated. This means the model is simulates nGen*nTrees birth-death events}

\item{nTrees}{Number of trees in the local community}

\item{Xext}{Size of the local community in x-direction}

\item{Yext}{Size of the local community in y-direction}

\item{avg}{logical variable: Should the model output be averaged over the replicate runs}
}
\value{
The model simulates virtual tree censuses with coordinates and species identities for each tree. The census data is only provided as output when nRep = 1 and avg = F. In this case the output is s list with three elements:
\enumerate{
   \item \bold{census} - a dataframe with x,y coordinates and species ID for every tree in the simulated community
   \item \bold{abundance} - a names vector with the number of individuals for every species
   \item \bold{summary.stats} a list with eigth elements that includes non-spatial and spatial summary statistics of the simulated community. The list elements are:
\enumerate{
   \item \bold{nSpecies} - Number of species
   \item \bold{Shannon} - Shannon diversity index \eqn{H = - \sum log(pi) * pi}
   \item \bold{Simpson} - Simpson diversity index \eqn{S = 1 - \sum 1/pi^2}, where pi is the relative abundance of species i. This essentially estimates the probability of randomly drawing two individuals from different species (probability of interspecific encounter)
   \item \bold{SAD} - species abundance distribution with logarithmic abundance classes (1, 2-3, 4-7, 8-15, ..., >=2048 individuals)
   \item \bold{Area} - sampling areas for species area relationship in m^2
   \item \bold{SAR} - species-area relationship: average species numbers in quadrats of different sizes
   \item \bold{Fr} - Proportion of conspecific neighbors: This estimates the probability that two trees seperated by distance r belong to the same species.
   \item \bold{PCF} - pair-correlation function. Measure of spatial aggregation of regularity across scales. A value of 1 indicates a random pattern, PCF > 1 indicates aggregation and PCF < 1 regularity (=repulsion of individuals)
}
}
When nRep > 1 or avg = T only the list with the summary statistics is returned.
